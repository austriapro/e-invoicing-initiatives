### Affected entities (B2B, B2G, B2C)

Austria mandates e-invoicing for B2G for all invoices sent to federal institutions. 

### e-invoice document standard

Austria uses its own national E-invoicing standard [ebInterface](https://www.ebinterface.at). In addition Peppol can be used to submit electronic invoices using the Universal Business Language (UBL) format. 

An overview of the used standards and fields can be found [here](https://www.erechnung.gv.at/erb/tec_formats_ebinterface).


### Transmission standards

Electronic invoice documents may be sent using one of the following channels:

 * Manual entry using a Web Form
 * Manual upload of an ebInterface XML instance using a Web Form
 * Sending ebInterface via a custom Web Service
 * Sending UBL via Peppol
 
Most of the electronic invoices in Austria are being sent via Web Service or Peppol. The use of Peppol has seen a significant uptake in recent years.
